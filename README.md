# dflow: CI-NEB combined with Pertubation to build the initial train set of DPGEN

## Introduction
This dflow proposal is used to construct the initial data set for dpgen iteration. The quality of the initial dataset will have a significant impact on the iterative convergence process. A good initial trainset can often accelerate the convergence.
